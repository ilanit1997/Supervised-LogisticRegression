# Supervised-LogisticRegression

Taken from wikipedia: 

Logistic regression is a statistical model that in its basic form uses a logistic function to model a binary dependent variable.
Logistic regression measures the relationship between the categorical dependent variable and one or more independent variables by estimating probabilities using a logistic function, which is the cumulative distribution function of logistic distribution. Thus, it treats the same set of problems as probit regression using similar techniques, with the latter using a cumulative normal distribution curve instead. Equivalently, in the latent variable interpretations of these two methods, the first assumes a standard logistic distribution of errors and the second a standard normal distribution of errors.


**Logistic Regression**

1. Cross validation implemantion.

2. Run 5-folds CV on Logistic Regression model with different lambdas. 

3. plot bar plot for every lambda value and compare train, validation and test errors.
